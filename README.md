# UWP_BT_PhoneKeyPad
Event driven sample Universal Windows Platform app that uses some custom UWP libraries to get keypresses from a Phone Keypad that is connected to an Arduino Uno. Connectivity is over Generic Bluetooth Serial.

## About
Based upon the previous *Generic Bluetooth Serial* project, this suite of projects provides:
* An Arduino Uno event driven Sketch that captures a phone keypad events _(pressed,up and held)_ and forwards them as simple text over Bluetooth Serial
* The Generic Bluetooth Serial UWP-Arduino connectivity as a UWP class library.
* A UWP class library that connects to the Arduino device over the BT class, captures the keypad messages and generates events.
* A UWP class library that captures the keypad keypress events and actions a configured delegate for each key.
* *_A sample app that connects the BT class to the Arduino device, as well as implementing a delegate for each key._*

These projects are part of a larger suite of projects on [Codeplex: KeypArd](https://keypard.codeplex.com/) and are discussed in greater detail on Embedded101.com:
Arduino Bluetooth Keypad Utilities: UWP BluetoothSerialLib A modularisation of the Generic Bluetooth Serial App extracting out all of the UI functionality. Received serial messages are interpreted as Phone Keypad events. Depends upon KeypadUWPLib as it fires the keypad events based upon received messages. Keypad Events UWP Library An event driven Phone Keypad library. Includes KeyDown, KeyUp and KeyHoldling events to which event handlers can be attached in apps that use this library. Also includes a mechanism to fire those events from keypad scanning software. No hardware specific code though. These events mirror those events in the previous blog for the Arduino Keypad Event Scanning Sketch.Â  The next blog hooks the two up.Event Keypad Sketch This Sketch scans a phone keypad using the Keypad library and detects key pressed, released and held events. The events generate a string that is sent serially denoting the event and key.Bluetooth Echo Sketch This Sketch is a slight modification of that published as a companion to the original General Bluetooth Serial App.UWP and Arduino Keypad Library on Codeplex
